# Cs50, Web Development with Python and Javascript Projects

 Below are the projects I have to  complete to acquire a certification from Havard via edx.org

* Search: a replica of Google's search engine's front-page with some of Google's own functionality.

* Wiki: a web app that accepts users' input as markdown and saves them. Later, these inputs can be queried and converted to pure html like wiki pages.

* Commerce: an ebay like e-commerce platform where users can add auctions totheir  watchlist, bid for them, comment under auctions, and do some other cool stuff
